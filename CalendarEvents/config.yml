# To let the plugin do something on these events, go to the section 'listener'.
# For more complex action on events, use the API.
# Please visit www.spigotmc.org/resources/35536/ for more information on the API.

  #  combined events can be used to create special scheduling like e.g. every first sunday of a month
  #  combined events contain a list of "normal" calendar event labels and are only fired when ALL of the listed events are fired

  # lets create some normal events to use in a combined event
  sunday: # every sunday
    timing:
      occasion: "sunday"
      time: "12:00" # SAME TIME AS THE OTHER EVENT BELOW (IMPORTANT)
  firstWeekOfMonth: # every day of the first week in a month

      occasion: "01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07"
      time: "12:00"

  # this event will fire on every first sunday in a month at 12:00

    events: # lables of the two "normal" events above

      - "firstWeekOfMonth"


# General Calendar Events settings
settings:
  # If your server is in a different timezone than the timezone you would like your events to be triggered in, you can configure the difference in hours here.
  # Example:
  #     Server:   UTC
  #     Players:  UTC +1
  #     configure offsetHours = 1
  #     The events above will trigger at the configured times for your UTC +1 players
  #     This setting supports negative values (e.g. -2 for Server UTC+2 and players UTC)
  offsetHours: 0
  # The locale defines the month and day names in the event (%day%, %month%).
  # Use an IETF language tag (see: https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/).
  language: "en"


# You can use the listener for basic actions such as
# sending commands, actionbars, broadcasts and titles

# use & for colors
# %time% will be replaced with the events time (24h format hh:mm)
# %day% will be replaced with the name of the day in the locale defined at 'settings.locale'
# %month% will be replaced with the name of the month in the locale defined at 'settings.locale'
